# OPERATING SYSTEMS II
This course teaches how interals of modern operating systems are working with hardware/software stack. In the course, we will learn fundamental concepts of operating systems by building an operating system by our own hand.

In particular, Labs are based on JOS, an educational OS project, and will build it starting from `booting` (lab1), to `virtual memory` (lab2), to `process` (lab3), and finally to `multi-tasking` (lab4). Also covers concurrency issues in systems by learning on how to implement locks and other synchronization mechanisms and how to resolve deadlock issues.

This course borrows lots of materials from MITâ€™s 6.828 (https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/overview.html), the original course that developed JOS, and also from CS3210 of the Georgia Institute of Technology (https://tc.gts3.org/cs3210/2016/spring/index.html) and CSE 451 of the University of Washington (https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/18au/).
